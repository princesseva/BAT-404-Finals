# Introduction

The oceans are one of Earth's greatest gifts to humans, teeming with life and providing everything from fresh food to jobs for millions who would otherwise be unemployed. These waters on which we rely may appear to be in great health, yet not everything is as it appears.
Seeing marine animals in their natural habitat can be an exhilarating experience, such as seeing a pod of dolphins leap across the water, a sea turtle breeding on a beach, or a seal colony sunbathing in the sun.

Marine conservation is also known as ocean conservation. The health of all life on Earth depends (directly or indirectly) on a healthy ocean. As humans began to realize their increasing impacts on the ocean, the field of marine conservation arose in response.
